# Vityarthi Project â€“ Autonomous Delivery Agent

This project implements an autonomous delivery agent navigating a 2D grid city.
The agent delivers packages while handling terrain costs, static obstacles,
and dynamic moving obstacles.

Algorithms implemented:
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- A* search with admissible heuristic
- Local search replanning (hill-climbing / simulated annealing)
